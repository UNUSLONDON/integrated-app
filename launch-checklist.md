## Common Issues & Solutions

### If the app fails to start:
1. Check Node.js version (v18+ recommended)
2. Verify all dependencies are installed (`npm install`)
3. Check for TypeScript compilation errors

### If authentication doesn't work:
1. For demo purposes, use email: `demo@chatapp.com` and password: `demo123`
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify auth store is properly initialized

### If chat messages don't appear:
1. Ensure you're logged in
2. Check chat store initialization
3. Verify component rendering of message list

### If data management doesn't connect:
1. For demo purposes, any valid-looking access token will work
2. For Airtable Base ID, use any string starting with "app"
3. Verify airtable store is initialized properly

## Next Steps After Launch

1. Replace mock APIs with real backend connections
2. Add error handling for failed API calls
3. Implement comprehensive testing
4. Add user onboarding flow
5. Optimize performance for production
